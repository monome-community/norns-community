Experimental performance and creative tool, mashing together several things that I like. REPL for interactive code creating. Grid to have a tactile UI (maybe we'll throw in a midi pedal too). Dance between client and host, between recording loops and loops that can modify other loops and themselves.

In other words, it's like **a looper-pedal. But for code.**
