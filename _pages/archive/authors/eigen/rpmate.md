## description

This script is a little util that allows to record a sound an play it back at various RPM ratios.

The main use is to replay the sample sped up into a hardware sampler to save memory and add some punch to samples ([demonstration of the effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7_9-ymumd4)).

It comes with its own fork of the timber engine with some tweaks, so a **_sleep_** is necessary.
