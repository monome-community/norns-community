sequence rows of beats with samples.

this norns script creates sequences of samples from a tape. you can load any tape and splice it into up to 26 samples (named a-z). samples can then be patterned into 16-subdivided measures. patterns can then be chained together.

this script was a hard one to make because at a certain point i kept getting caught up playing with for hours instead of making it "user friendly." let me know if you find things to improve!

this script builds off others. it is inspired a lot from ideas in [glitchlets](https://llllllll.co/t/glitchlets) (no realtime here) and a lot of code ideas from @mattbiddulph's exquisite [beets](https://llllllll.co/t/beets-1-0/30069) (initially i forked beets but i didn't want to ruin the code with my hacks). also inspiration from the po-33. and, it is inspired by @csboling's beautiful waveform renderings in the latest update.

future directions:

- fix all the üêõüêõüêõ
- add individual parameters for samples
- add play trigger
- ?? requests
