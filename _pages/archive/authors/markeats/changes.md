Generate eight connected sine wave LFOs and output them over MIDI.

![changes.png](/community/markeats/changes.png)

Very simple script to generate really slow LFOs (cycles from 1 sec to 24 hours).
I built this for myself for [Drone Day 2020](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/644328852) but sharing it in the hope itâ€™s useful to others also. this one i likely won't be maintaining.

## Requirements
MIDI out
