## description

there are Four tape loops with individual speed settings and you can record external audio onto one of them. At any time you may set the record head to another loop however, splitting the external audio across the loops, which are stereo-panned from left to right. An overdub level control lets you adjust the mix between the old audio on the tape loop and the new one on the fly. Itâ€™s fun :smiley:
