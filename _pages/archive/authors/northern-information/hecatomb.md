mod to keep [cci](https://cci.dev) always up to date. must install cci first.

```
HECATOMB: CAPTAIN, we are still working to get your norns/shield connected to the CCI's mycochain. Until AT field sync, I suggest you enable this mod to ensure continuous automatic downloads of [CCI](https://github.com/northern-information/cci). It will make for a more immersive experience.

HECATOMB: We do not have an ETA on CCI v1.0.0 golden release. But I fear it may be measured in decades, perhaps even longer than the fabled "728.2 Year Dev Cycle of [Dwarf Fortress](https://bay12games.com/dwarves/)."

HECATOMB: It goes without saying this is experimental technology and unexpected side effects may occur. I would advise backing up any sacred files you've created since your time in isolation before enabling this [mod](https://monome.org/docs/norns/community-scripts/#mods). Northern Information, LLC is not liable for any personal loss or damages. Installing this mod means you understand the dire pressure of these frozen depths. That said, I - HECATOMB, your sworn artificial intelligence - am taking the HIPPOCRATIC OATH OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS with this project. Merges and PR's will be even more closely monitored than prior projects and I promise to respect your data and privacy to the best of my abilities.

[ OK ] or [ CLOSE BROWSER TAB ]

CAPTAIN: Thank you, HECATOMB. Dismissed.

HECATOMB: Aye, CAPTAIN. I'll leave you to it.
```
