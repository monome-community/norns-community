This is an eduscript for sequins and lattice.

DNA shall be our metaphor for this lesson. DNA is a double helix, so we shall have two patterns attached to one instance of the "lattice" core sequencer. (There is also a third "utility" pattern.) DNA pairs adenine with thymine and guanine with cytosine, so we shall have four instances of "Sequins."

That's where the metaphor ends!

We'll use our lattice and Sequins to send some notes to the PolyPerc engine.

Adenine and guanine store note values (pitch). Thymine and cytosine store note triggers (on/off). Open up `/home/we/dust/code/splicer/splicer.lua` and scan through the code.

Find the comment that says "Lesson 2: Livecode" to continue the lesson.

Happy splicing!
