## description

tunnels is a collection of randomized, experimental stereo delays built using softcut. the base script does not include an engine that makes sound, so you will need to provide via the inputs. users are encouraged to create new modes. all of the mode names - along with much of the inspiration - are taken from 'An Interface for a Fractal Landscape' by Ed Steck (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2019). thanks, Ed.
