grid 128 is the most standard grid size, and as a result supported by the most scripts.

nonetheless, some scripts provide support to other grid sizes.

## arbitrary grid size

The following script can work on *any* grid size, even the most exotic ones.

- [arcologies](/authors/northern-information/arcologies)
- [bistro](https://llllllll.co/t/bistro/45349)
- [goldeneye](/authors/northern-information/goldeneye)
- [grid_test](https://llllllll.co/t/grid-test/29346)
- [loom](/authors/markeats/loom)
- [zellen](https://llllllll.co/t/zellen/21107)

## grid 64

[relevant lines thread](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-scripts-for-a-64-grid/29503)

some script natively detect the size of current grid and can switch to a 64 specific layout.

- [cheat_codes_2](/authors/dan_derks/cheat_codes_2)
- [gridstep](/authors/quixotic7/gridstep)
- [mouse](/authors/cfd90/mouse) (in fact only a 64 layout, which is also compatible with 128)
- [kolor](/authors/infinitedigits/kolor)
- [timber](https://llllllll.co/t/timber/21407)

some others don't, but forks were made to add 64 compatibility:

- `glut` ([fork](https://llllllll.co/t/glut/21175/51))
- `less_concept_2` ([fork](https://llllllll.co/t/less-concepts/21109/195))
- `mlr` ([fork](https://llllllll.co/t/mlr-norns/21145/467))
- [otis](/authors/justmat/otis) ([fork](https://llllllll.co/t/otis/22149/155))
- `patchwork` ([fork](https://llllllll.co/t/patchwork/28800/61))


## alternative grids

Scripts can be patched with [midigrid](/authors/jaggednz/midigrid) to support alternative grid constructors (Launchpads, ableton push ...).
