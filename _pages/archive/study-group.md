the norns study group is a community run discord server. we meet once a week on saturdays for video study sessions. come hang out, share what you're working on, ask for help, and meet our cats.

[midding](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/174141113510/midding) is encouraged.

> **midding** v. *intr.* feeling the tranquil pleasure of being near a gathering but not quite in it—hovering on the perimeter of a campfire, chatting outside a party while others dance inside, resting your head in the backseat of a car listening to your friends chatting up front—feeling blissfully invisible yet still fully included, safe in the knowledge that everyone is together and everyone is okay, with all the thrill of being there without the burden of having to be.

go ahead and lurk, camera off, & let your zoom fatigue fade.
