# choukanzu （鳥瞰図）
Choukanzu adds several params to the bottom of the params list.
`fly` is The Big Knob; turn it to morph between flight formations. does nothing at first.
`flock` summons `birds` to watch the flight pattern of params.
Each bird lets you choose a `control` or `taper` param to watch;
be warned, changing the selection of a bird's param will clear the whole flock's memory of flight formations.
trigger `watch` to store the state of the watched params as the latest flight formation.
