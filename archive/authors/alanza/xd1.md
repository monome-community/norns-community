# XD1
This is an attempt at making a synthesizer without writing a UGen.
It’s based on FM7,
and uses the 32 FM algorithms from the DX7.
I haven’t striven for feature-parity with the DX7,
and in fact xD1 has filters, where the DX7 has none.
Nonetheless, the control setup is very similar.
Each operator has an envelope, a ratio and an index.
