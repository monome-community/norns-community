## description

ONG is an ocean noise generator for Monome Norns.

Even by the standards in the Norns ecosystem this script might be considered a bit more experimental than some others, A little bit akin to the [Showers](/authors/justmat/showers) script by [justmat](/authors/justmat).

ONG is deeply inspired by the Ocean Noise Generator "guitar" pedal built by [Syntherjack](https://syntherjack.net/ocean-noise-generator/). I'm releasing this software version with permission from them.

## controls
There are a few controls to alter the sound, but ultimately it is several noise generators running through filters, being modulated by LFOs.

Norns controls are:

- K1 display help
- E1 overall amplitude
- E2 near waves amplitude
- K2+E2 near waves speed
- K3+E2 foam amplitude
- E3 far waves amplitude
- K2+E3 far waves speed
- K3+E3 ambience amplitude
