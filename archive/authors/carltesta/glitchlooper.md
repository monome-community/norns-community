## description

GLitch Looper is the first script I worked on back in 2018 but never finished. Originally written for guitarist chris cretella, this looper has 5 unsynchronized loops that can be played back normally (beginning to end) or glitched (random start and stop points). Additionally, there is an auto mode which activates a function that randomly records and starts playing at different times on all 5 separate loops. The rate of the automatic changes are controlled by audio analysis conducted at the audio input. By default, more onsets increases the amount of time between changes. that relationship can be flipped by changing the density parameter.
