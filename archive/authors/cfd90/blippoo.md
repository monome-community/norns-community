> ~ Rob Hordijk

by: [`@cfd90`](/authors/cfd90)

## install

* install from community script list (requires reboot)

## documentation

The main Norns UI provides two pages of performance controls. The first page affects the oscillators and output volume, and the second page affects the twin peaks (filters). A third page affects the built-in delay effect.


- `KEY 2` tap for oscillators page
- `KEY 3` tap for filters page
- `KEY 1` hold for delay page
- `ENC 1` / `ENC 2` / `ENC 3` alter params on page

For more detailed control of the synth, head to the PARAMS page. All of the modulation controls are located here (FM from S&H, the Rungler, and oscillators). **Small adjustments can have a drastic effect on sound, so hold KEY 3 when changing parameters to finely tune them!**
