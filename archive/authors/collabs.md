as open-source artifacts, scripts are easy to modify for individual needs. sometimes, an editing artist will find passion for a script made by another, to the point where their modifications result in useful extension of the original. in these cases, scripting collaborations are born.

the `collab` category holds scripts which have exchanged hands and deepend with new perspective + energy.

curious about the etiquitte of collabs + forking? see [this thread on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/39028) for more detail + discussion.
