## description

a single sine tone that reflects the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

there are no controls.

to change the output, change your habits and elect politicians who support strong and immediate climate action.

when the tone reaches C4, we will have likely reached 1.5c of warming, the threshold for severe climate impacts on people, wildlife and ecosystems.

### suggestions:

- tune your oscillators to the health of the planet
- plug in crow to get a cv output in the 0-10v range on all four channels
- use it as a way to start conversations about climate with music friends


## install
