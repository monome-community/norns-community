* Stretch audio samples to the extreme, until they are almost frozen in time
* Four separate audio buffers that can be manipulated
* Add multi-octave harmonisation
* Create movement and space with panning LFO
* live recording for immediate stretching
* bandpass filter for mixing
* Based on Paulstretch algorithm

**position** sets where the sound is in the stereo field.
**lfo spread** sets how far the sound will be moved by the lfo.
**lfo rate** controls how long it takes the pan lfo to complete a cycle.

### filter

*a basic bandpass filter*

**freq** sets the centre frequency.
**width** sets the width of the filter from the centre freq, in octaves.
