## description

stereo spreader fx for monome norns based on xfer’s vst plugin

–

The dimension expander, originally part of NI’s synthesizer Massive, is a chorus/stereo spreader based on a 1980’s Roland FX Unit called the Roland Dimension D. Xfer later released this also as a freeware VST plugin. This version is an attempt at replicating the dimension expander in norns as closely as possible. It allows stereo spreading of stereo sources or stereo spreading of mono sources (from left channel input).
