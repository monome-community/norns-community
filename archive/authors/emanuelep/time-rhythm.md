## description

explore the relationship between polythythms and duophonic harmonies. Time-rhythm is a simple 2-oscillator pulse wave synthesizer. The individual frequencies can be adjusted with the lower encoder. Both frequencies can be divided or multiplied together using the top encoder to maintain the same frequency ratio between the two oscillator and move between tonal and rhythmical domain. lower keys can be used to add/remove compression or change pulse width for harmonical or rhythmical variations within the same pitch/speed.
