## description

luck is a probabilistic sequencer

Each of the seven nodes of the sequencer can be assigned a pitch and velocity. When in probability mode (hold K3), each node can also be assigned connection probabilities which determines the probability of which node to go to next.

```
-- E1: mode
-- E2: select node 
-- E3: set value
-- K2: start/stop
-- K3: hold down for probability 
--     mode
```

This was the first script I wrote to get my feet wet with norns programming.
