## User guides
### how to edit a script

Look in the script for a line that mentions 'grid.connect' this can be in the main script or in a other places like the lib folder.

the line will look like:

`g = grid.connect`
or 
`local grid`

> if the script uses `g = grid.connect` then add a line above that with
> ``local grid = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid``
{.is-info}


> If the script uses one of these lines:
> `local g`
> `local grid`
> `local grid_device`
> 
> then add this to that line
> ` = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid`
{.is-info}

These edits will check whether midigrid is installed and if so, assign it to the grid variable. 
If midigrid is not installed, it will assign the original grid resources instead.


### step by step guide document
[Getting a Novation Launchpad Mini Mk3 working with a Monome Norns Shield ](https://llllllll.co/uploads/short-url/16hRxTpCb628yyF1Lg90Ce2QJNs.pdf) - by @helen

> older Launchpads like the launchpad mini mk1 & mk2 do not have a programmers mode, this step(s) can be safely ignored.
{.is-info}

To avoid that scripts auto-connect to your midigrid controller and use it as a normal MIDI device, make sure your controller is not in norns' midi devices list or that dummy devices are in slots 1 and 2 (e.g. the virtual midi device). This way your controller stays free and can be used as a midigrid.

### Plugging multiple devices
> port order matters: above to below
{.is-success}

to get device #1 & #2 in the right order from boot:

- plug #1 above and #2 below in the same column of ports
## adding support to your script

### Basic 128 button grid support (works with 64 button devices!)

This is the best option for *most* scripts, for users with a single 64 button device they may be able to swtich between two pages using auxillery buttons on their device, please consider if your script splits well into two halves

```lua
local grid = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/mg_128" or grid
```

### Basic 64 button grid support 

this is the best option for scripts that require simulanous button presses across the surface and that can resize to the device. e.g. loom
```lua
local grid = util.file_exists(_path.code.."midigrid") and include "midigrid/lib/midigrid" or grid
```
> using This method is safe to distribute your script to other users who may not have midigrid installed or who maybe using a monome grid device
{.is-info}

## what to buy - should i buy x

> buying multiples of the top tier launchpad devices quickly matches the price of a monome grid. Please consider supporting the monome ecosystem by buying a monome device if your budget and requirements permit
{.is-warning}

It is hard to make recommendations as to what is best to buy as everyones budget, requirements and local markets vary. my interest in midigrid started because i already owned a launchpad mini mk1 purchased at full retail some years ago. I quickly purchased a second launchpad second hand for around $40NZD once i realised that two devices working as one grid was possible.

Buying one or two second hand launchpad mk1 mini or mk2 mini is the cheapest option if you are on a budget. the second device can easily be purchased later if want the full 128 buttons.

buying a single more expensive (RGB) device might make more sense if you are a big user of ableton live or other software with lauchpad support and want a basic taste of the grid experiance on norns.

> early launchpad rgb devices like the launchpad mk2 (full size) are starting to show up at reasonable prices (<$60USD) on the s/h market.

## demos

### stirhouse - Launchpad Pro MK3
> After some setup I am now able to control both Ableton and Norns simultaneously via my Launchpad Pro MK3, using an iConnectMIDI4+ as the middle man (but any USB MIDI host should be able to do the same thing)
