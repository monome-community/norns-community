boingg was originally inspired by @artfwo's flin and written by @declutter on lines. i updated it for norns 2.0

boingg has three output choices. **audio**, **ii jf**, or **midi**. 

for audio, boingg uses the ``polysub`` engine. you'll find engine controls in the parameters menu, as well as controls for ``tempo``, ``probability``, and ``transpose``.

**ii jf** will require a crow connected to a just friends module.

**midi** is output on channel 1.

## control

* key2 starts a ball bouncing
* key3 stops ball from bouncing

### grid

* press the bottom key to stop

## installation
boingg is available via the maiden project manager
