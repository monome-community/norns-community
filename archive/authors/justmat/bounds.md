stereo delay/looper with probabilistic kinetic sequencing
by [@justmat](/authors/justmat)
## controls

* key1 = shift
* key2 = add ball
* key3 = select ball
* shift + key2 = remove ball
* shift + key3 = hold buffer

* enc2 = rotate ball
* enc3 = ball speed
* shift + enc1 = probability
* shift + enc2/3 = feedback l/r

## balls

depending on your probability settings, when a ball collides with the edge of the screen an event may occur.
the nature of this event is determined by the x, y coordinates of the collision. the bounds are pictured bellow.

* speed mod = currently a random choice of either half speed, or full speed. this will change soon.
* flip = change tape direction, maintaining speed.
* skip = reset loop

## installation
bounds is available via the maiden project manager
