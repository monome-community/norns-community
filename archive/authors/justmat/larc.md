# getting started

when starting larc, you'll be looping a blank section of tape.
![larc-start.png](/community/justmat/larc-start.png)

this is indicated by an L in the top left corner of your screen, and the absence of a waveform drawing. press key 3 to toggle recording/looping. the counter in the top right corner tracks the record head position.

at this point, your arc will be focused on amplitude. turn arc ring 2 and 3 to bring up the amplitude of your 2nd and 3rd play heads, revealing them on the screen.

hold key 1 and touch an arc ring to change the arc focus.

* ring 1 = amplitude
* ring 2 = speed
* ring 3 = pan position
* ring 4 = filter cutoff

----------

while amplitude, panning, and cutoff behave intuitively as knobs increasing or decreasing a value, speed is less intuitive.

first, use ring 4 to set a pre-speed value. then, move a ring 1 - 3 to set the play head speed. moving a ring counter-clockwise will set the play head to reverse.

----------

press key2 to toggle record head and loop settings.

* norns enc 1 = feedback
* norns enc 2 = loop start
* norns enc 3 = loop end
* norns key 1 + enc 1 = record speed
* arc ring 4 = loop/window shift

----------

to clear the buffer hold key 1 and press key 2
