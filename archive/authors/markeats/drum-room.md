MIDI-controlled drum kits for norns.

[![drum-room.png](/community/markeats/drum-room.png)video on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzBuAq9B961/)

Simple functionality with Scott Pilgrim inspired visuals. I was just after a convenient way of using norns as a drum module with an external sequencer or drum pads.

- Use the built-in kits or create your own based on the templates in lib.
- Each sound has tune, decay, pan and amp/overdrive parameters.
- Global sample length, filter, drive, compressor and (very) low-fi mode.

## Requirements
Timber engine
MIDI note input (eg, drum pad or sequencer)
