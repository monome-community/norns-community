Classic polysynth with solar system patch creator.

Juno-6 voice structure with chorus, the extra modulation of a Jupiter-8, and CS-80 inspired ring modulation. This isnâ€™t a proper emulation but you can definitely make space sounds.

The included lib should make it easy to use the engine in other scripts. Uses the same engine commands as Passersby for note on/off etc.

## Requirements
MIDI or grid note input (eg, keyboard, sequencer, grid)
