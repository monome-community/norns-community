## documentation

jiffy is a looper with a short buffer length, inspired by the restrictions of pedals like the ehx 16 second delay.

built using [sam](/authors/justmat/sam) as a starting point, with the emphasis on being quick (and fun) to operate.

Playing with speed and slew while recording gives some nice zippy results. The playhead goes a bit wonky after serious tweakage, but maybe that's part of the charm, remember to record your jams to tape ;)
