## description

<p>For monome <a href="https://monome.org/docs/norns">norns</a> and <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid">grid</a>, <strong>arcologies</strong> is a 21st century instrument for musical composition and discovery.</p>
    <p>The core design objective for this software is clarity. Each key and encoder on norns have a dedicated function. All the keys on the grid share the same behavior. The menus are built to be fast, intuitive, cohesive, and consistent. With a foundation that is (hopefully) quick to master, the arcologist's focus can shift to sculpting emergent and complex compositions.</p>
    <p>The design of <strong>arcologies</strong> heavily inspired by the two-dimensionality of <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">Orca</a>, the polymorphism of <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">ornament & crime</a>, the immediacy of <a href="https://monome.org/docs/meadowphysics/">meadowphysics</a>, and the uncompromising vision of <a href="https://l.llllllll.co/cheat-codes">cheat codes</a>. I've always been interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a> and wanted to push that line of inquiry further than I have before. Other curios played a part, too: <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense</a> genre, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>, and the <a href="http://generativemusic.com/">Eno / Chilvers</a> suite of generative applications, carbon-based life, water, the anthropocene, supply chains, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World">The Mushroom at the End of the World</a>, <a href="https://dark-mountain.net/">The Dark Mountain Project</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eco-futurism-corp">Eco Futurism Corp</a>, <a href="https://danielseankelly.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/in-the-days-of-the-seasteaders-or-how-the-extropian-detritivores-broke-capitalism/">"seasteading"</a>, the gedankenexperiment-prompt: "sound artist's work in a William Gibson novel?", <a href="https://journal.highlandsolutions.com/cellular-automata-in-javascript-c0336af3e1f3">Conway's Game of Life</a>, Garfield Park Conservatory, the Epcot Center, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a>, and the need to challenge myself and create something beautiful during this fucking pandemic. And, of course, actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology">arcologies</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism_(architecture)">the architectural movement known as <em>metabolism</em></a>.</p>
