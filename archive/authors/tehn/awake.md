## description

two looped sequences. the first sounds notes, the second transposes the notes of the first. loop lengths can change. sequences can be morphed and randomized. configurable scales and root notes.

the polyperc engine is included: a simple polyphonic filtered decaying square wave. parameters are all controllable. a vari-speed delay with feedback is on the end.

awake is a super-minimal reduction of kria.
