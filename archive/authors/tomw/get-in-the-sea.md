# get in the sea!
your norns plays Terry riley's 'in c'.

![get-in-the-sea.png](/community/tomw/get-in-the-sea.png)

## Requirements
- norns
- MIDI (optional)
- mx.samples (optional)

## Documentation
K2 - Start / Stop play
K3 - Go back to the start

Configure your performance in the parameters menu and then set it off.

It will output MIDI, crow (not tested) or audio using PolyPerc as the default engine but sounds really nice using mx.samples as the engine with different instruments for each player. There are params for the probability of repeating a phrase rather than moving on and to limit how far the players can get ahead of the furthest behind.
