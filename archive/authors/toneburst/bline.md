## description

Bline is a parametric acid-style bassline explorer inspired by the “Topographic Drum Sequencer” concept developed by Mutable Instruments and initially used in their Anushri DIY synthesiser, later forming the basis of their Grids Eurorack-format module.

It takes the form of a Lua script for the Norns Sound Computer platform by Monome, and will run on an original Norns, the DIY Norns Shield or Fates hardware.

Bline creates bassline patterns which can be played by standalone hardware or virtual-instrument Roland TB-303 emulators via MIDI. An internal bass synthesiser SuperCollider engine is also provided for standalone use (though external hardware is recommended).
