*norns has a built-in realtime sampling layer called `softcut`. it's always running and is able to capture external audio or sounds from the engines. many of the scripts in this section control softcut and cover nearly every corner of delay and looping paradigms.*

> want to build your looper, sampler or delay? check out the [softcut studies](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-softcut-studies/23585).
