*norns can communicate with a huge number of other devices, making it a great place to write and run utility scripts. of course there's the other monome devices: [crow](https://monome.org/docs/crow/), [grid](https://monome.org/docs/grid/), and [arc](https://monome.org/docs/arc/), but norns can also communicate with other midi devices, "human input" devices (mouse, keyboard, etc.), and more.*
