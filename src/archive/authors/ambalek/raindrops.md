## description

Raindrops is a generative script that makes melodies. Featuring 𝖑𝖔𝖋𝖎 𝖘𝖓𝖔𝖜𝖋𝖑𝖆𝖐𝖊𝖘. You can listen to it and try pressing the buttons or turning the knobs, but I found it works best if you sample something from it externally with a looper, then layer new melodies on top.


## install

from maiden (the norns web interface, in the command prompt not the main text area for Lua source code), type
`;install https://github.com/ambalek/raindrops`
