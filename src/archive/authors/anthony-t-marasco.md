## bio

Anthony T. Marasco is a composer and sound artist who takes influence from the aesthetics of today's Digimodernist culture, exploring the relationships between the eccentric and the everyday, the strict and the indeterminate, and the retro and the contemporary. These explorations result in a wide variety of works written for electroacoustic ensembles, interactive computer performance systems, and multimedia installations. 

An internationally-recognized artist, his music and installations have been presented across the United States as well as in Norway, Italy, Brazil, Denmark, and Canada. He has received commissions from performers and institutions such as WIRED Magazine, Phyllis Chen, the American Composers Forum Philadelphia, Quince Contemporary Vocal Ensemble, Toy Piano Composers, the Rhymes With Opera New Chamber Music Workshop, Data Garden, Maureen Batt, and the soundSCAPE International Composition Exchange. Marasco was the grand-prize winner of the UnCaged Toy Piano Festival's Call for Scores, a resident artist at Signal Culture Experimental Media Labs, and a grant winner for the American Composers Forum’s “If You Could Hear These Walls” project. His works and research have been featured at festivals such as New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), the Web Audio Conference, the Toronto International Electroacoustic Symposium, the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the U.S. (SEAMUS), Electroacoustic Barn Dance, New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC), the National Student Electronic Music Event (NSEME), Mise-En Festival, Montreal Contemporary Music Lab, Electric LaTex, and Omaha Under the Radar. 

Marasco is an Assistant Professor of Music Technology and Composition at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. His research focuses on topics such as web audio, hardware hacking, and creating hardware and software tools for networked music performance practices. He is a co-developer of Collab-Hub.io along with Nick Hwang and Eric Sheffield. His dissertation research centered on extending mediated and networked performance techniques to circuit-bent readymade devices through the creation of a hardware/software framework called Bendit_I/O.
