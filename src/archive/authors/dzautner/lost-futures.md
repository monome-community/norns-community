# lost futures

Bass synth for the **[Monome Norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/)** inspired by the **[TB-303](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TB-303)**.  

> “Invited to think of the futuristic, we will still come up with something like the music of Kraftwerk, even though this is now as antique as Glenn Miller’s big band jazz was when the German group began experimenting with synthesizers in the early 1970s.”
  ― Mark Fisher, Ghosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures


The sound engine is based on a TB-303 simulator found in **[overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/blob/master/src/overtone/synth/retro.clj)**.
