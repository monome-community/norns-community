punch-in tempo-locked repeating.

this is a tempo-locked repeater or "stutter delay" effect that can be punched-in during live performance. this effect is inspired by the op-1's chop" [tape trick](https://teenage.engineering/guides/op-1/tape-mode). for *clcks* i wanted a similar tape trick effects that could be used live. using *clcks* and the pitch shift encoder you can create all sorts of repeats and tape speed-ups/slow-downs.

future plans: 

- fix "click" sound on slower delays
- fix panning
- add ping-pong panning

### Requirements

- audio input
- norns

### Documentation

- press K2 or K3 to activate
- press K2 or K3 to deactivate
- (K2 keeps monitoring audio)
- E1 changes repeat number
- E2/E3 change final level/rate
- hold K1 to shift
- shift+E2 changes tempo
- shift+E3 changes subdivision
- shift+K2 resets parameters
- shift+K3 randomizes

other notes:

- max repeats means infinite repeating, so you have to toggle off with K2 or K3
