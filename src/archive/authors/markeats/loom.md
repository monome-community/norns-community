Pattern weaving sequencer for grids.

[![loom.png](/community/markeats/loom.png)video on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoXcWG5AFrw/)

Slightly generative, surprisingly controllable, works with Molly the Poly or speaks MIDI.
Concept by @instantjuggler

## Documentation
Triggers move horizontally. Notes move vertically. Pitches are mapped across the note columns. When triggers and notes collide they sound.

Hold a grid key and press another on the same row or column to add a trigger or note.
Three keys at once clears a row or column.

E3 can be used to add random triggers and notes (no grid required) or remove the most recent additions to a pattern. It’s a quick way to make variations of an existing pattern.

Don’t forget to check the parameters list for synth options – patch creation lives right at the end.
