Wave folding, FM, LPG, spring-ish reverb, LFO and two dice to roll.

The included lib should make it easy to use the engine in other scripts â€“ here's a [super-simple demo.](https://gist.github.com/markwheeler/ca2d5fa0b09bd15db8e0b90991150ce1)

## Requirements

MIDI or grid note input (eg, keyboard, sequencer, grid)
