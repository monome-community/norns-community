## description

This is a simple sequencing toy with a gimmicky twist. A looping ribbon of sequential guesses runs over the sequence, attempting to lock a solution. Locked notes are played, unquantized. If user input “unsolves” a step it returns that step to its unplayed state until the new value is discovered.

The result is that notes are discovered in ascending order, and it’s pretty pleasant to hear (polyperc and midi) the sequence develop.
