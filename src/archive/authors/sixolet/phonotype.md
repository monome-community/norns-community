# PHONOTYPE

Phonotype is a livecoding environment for Norns.

It is like Teletype but for sound.

Useful for:

* Custom midi synths
* Effects chains of your dreams
* Fluid live-coding, changing the control flow as you go
* An entire dang modular in this box yo

phonotype code is all caps, and norns.community likes lowercase very much.

That's pretty cool, and I like lowercase too, but to avoid being confusing go find the documentation for phonotype at [its github page](https://github.com/sixolet/phonotype).
