# step 0: üëç learn the conventions
> **look for info in these green boxes to understand the conventions that _must_ be followed for the [gallery](https://norns.community/en/gallery) to function properly.**
{.is-success}


# step 1: üóùÔ∏è login

welcome! to edit or add new pages to the norns.community wiki, you'll need to log in here: https://norns.community/login

there are two separate login tracks, depending on how you wish to contribute:

- script authors: for those who wish to add documentation for their scripts
- non-scripting editors: for those who wish to modify or create waypoints for catalog exploration. this includes the individual category pages, but can also expand to lists like *scripts which support monobright 8x8 grids*.

this guide is focused on script authors, but the mechanics are similar for editors. the main difference is where you're able to add or edit content.

### author role
- you'll use GitHub to sso into this wiki
- authors can create and edit any page or asset under the `/authors` filetree
- authors can edit (but not create) any page under the `/script-categories` filetree
- authors cannot edit `faq` or `home`

### editor role
- you'll use discord to sso into this wiki (if you haven't already, please join the [norns study server](https://discord.gg/Y2fmdZBAfp) to access this role)
- editors can create and edit any pages under `/script-categories` (and we can add more sections!)
- editors cannot edit `faq`, `home`, or `/authors` pages

# step 2: ü§∏ create your author page

from any page click the "new page" icon in the upper menu.

![new-page.png](/meta/new-page.png)

select the `authors` folder and replace `new-page` with your name.

> **if your author name has spaces, replace them with hyphens or underscores.**
>
> so "northern information" becomes "northern-information"
{.is-success}

![enter-your-name.png](/meta/enter-your-name.png)

this creates a "landing page" for your author profile, where people can learn more about your work. use this Markdown template to fill yours out:

```
## bio

if you wanna!

## scripts

<iframe src="https://p3r7.github.io/norns-gallery-render/?author=northern-information"id="gallery-iframe"></iframe>

## links

- [personal site](url)
- [bandcamp](url)
- [GitHub](url)
```

be sure to replace the `author` string in the `iframe` with yours to automatically pull in all your scripts.

> **a small piece of crucial context**
this site features a loosely-coupled integration with a [small clojurescript application](https://github.com/p3r7/norns-gallery) developed by `@eigen` and `@tyleretters`. the application leverages the [wiki.js `GQL` ](https://docs.requarks.io/dev/api) to render collections of scripts in iframes across the site. any reference to `iframes` are talking about this piece of tech.

# Step 3: üìü create your script page

> **if your script name has spaces, replace them with hyphens.**
>
> so "molly the poly" becomes "molly-the-poly"
{.is-success}

follow the same steps above for your script page. try to name the page exactly as you've named your script elsewhere (maiden, github, lines, etc.)

> **please nest your scripts under your author page, eg. `authors/justmat/otis`**
your author page doubles as an author *folder* once you add another page under it!
{.is-success}

here is a suggested script template. you can see how this renders, [here](https://norns.community/en/authors/northern-information/dronecaster).

feel free to add or remove whatever sections make sense for your script.

we recommend using the wiki.js "markdown" editor. if you're new to markdown, you can click the green question mark to get a handy guide:
![markdown.png](/meta/markdown.png)

## adding tags

tags are used to organize data on this site.

> **at least one tag must be added for your script for the iframe galleries to pick it up.**
{.is-success}

![add-tags.png](/meta/add-tags.png)

current tags are:

- `art`
- `audio fx`
- `delays + loopers`
- `drums`
- `generative`
- `granulators`
- `samplers`
- `sequencers`
- `synths`
- `utilities`

> **non-sanctioned tags will be deleted!** if you think a new tag ought to be added let us know. adding new tags requires a small amount of admin work as well as a [pull request](https://github.com/p3r7/norns-gallery/pull/1).
{.is-danger}

## adding i/o icons

additionally, there are six i/o icons available. apply any of these tags to your script and the icons will appear in the iframe galleries:

- `arc`
- `crow`
- `grid`
- `keyboard`
- `midi`
- `mouse`

## adding images

> **at least one `.png` on your script page _must_ be named exactly the same as the script for the homepage gallery to pick it up.**
>
> **additionally**, the image must be hosted here on https://norns.community. this is because our [custom gallery](https://github.com/p3r7/norns-gallery) builds the URL with the following logic:
>
> `"https://norns.community/community/" + <authorname> + "/" + <scriptname> + ".png"`
>
> for example, dronecaster's script page is: `https://norns.community/northern-information/dronecaster`
> 
> so our image _must_ be found at `https://norns.community/northern-information/dronecaster.png`
{.is-success}

> here's how to take a screenshot: https://monome.org/docs/norns/help/#png
{.is-info}

from the editor window click "insert assets"

![insert-assets.png](/meta/insert-assets.png)

> **before moving on, please confirm you are in the `/community/` folder and not in `/root`!**
{.is-success}

under `/community/`, create a folder for yourself using your author name

![create-an-author-directory.png](/meta/create-an-author-directory.png)

> **after your asset folder is created, you'll need to select it in the UI**
{.is-warning}

drag an asset onto the grey box on the right side, then Click "upload"

![upload-assets.png](/meta/upload-assets.png)

after your asset is uploaded, you can select it in the filepicker and click "insert". to delete an asset, click the three dots `...` under *actions*

> fyi, wiki.js can't delete folders yet: https://feedback.js.wiki/wiki/p/delete-folders-in-the-image-file-manager

# Step 4: ‚ô®Ô∏è get in the index

last step is to add yourself to the [authors index](/authors/index). if you have any trouble, just DM one of the admins. current admins are:

- `@dan_derks`
- `@eigen`
- `@tehn`
- `@tyleretters`
