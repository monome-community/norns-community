Have you ever looked at the wonderful rebound script and been reminded of a certain videogame? I have.

### Requirements

* Norns
* MIDI (optional)

### Documentation

Each block is assigned a note within the limits set in the parameters. When a ball hits a block, that note sounds. After being hit 4 times, blocks are removed. When a ball hits the bottom of the screen the root note sounds.

Standard rebound controls remain:

K1 - shift

K2 - add/remove ball

K3 - change active ball

E2 - change angle

E3 - change speed


K1 + K2 = Game Mode! Use E3 to move

### Bugs
Collision detection could do with some improvements. Only the face of bricks is detected, not the sides.
