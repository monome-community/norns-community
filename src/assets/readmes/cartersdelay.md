This script started its life as a toy I made in SuperCollider for my (then) 6-year-old cousin. I found myself having a lot of fun with it, so I baked it into [SuperLied](https://llllllll.co/t/superlied/64557?u=williamhazard), which was the script I was using for live performance at that time. And I used it a lot! 

A few months ago, a friend asked me whether it would be possible to make something like Carter's Delay for norns. I said I thought it would be, but at the time, I wasn't interested in doing it. I was, however, pretty interested in developing things for [seamstress](https://llllllll.co/t/seamstress-is-a-lua-scripting-environment-for-musical-communication/64556), so I did that and shared it [here](https://llllllll.co/t/carters-delay-seamstress/66651?u=williamhazard) as a starting place for a possible Carter's Delay script for norns. Eventually, I found myself wanting that to exist and, with some help from Jonathan Snyder, was able to make that happen. Here it is.
