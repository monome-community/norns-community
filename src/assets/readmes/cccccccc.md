# cccccccc


Each dial of the arc can send either a constant value or an LFO. The last touched dial is highlighted on the display and its parameters can be refined on the norns in the following ways:

– encoder 1: lfo type

– encoder 2: set cc amp (range maybe better term?)

– encoder 3: set cc offset

– key 2: toggle lfo/dial mode

– key 3: change focus to next dial
