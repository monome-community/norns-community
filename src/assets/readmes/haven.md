# haven.

*a safe space?*

![](media/haven.jpg)

A software synth for the [norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/) platform. 

Two unique oscillators: one high, one low. 
One self-oscillating feedback loop with built-in ladder filter, smearing the pitch of the oscillators. 
Finally, audio in.

Control? No. But a lot of influence.
