# justharmonicon

***justharmonicon is a two-track sequencer driven by four independent rhythm sections. Each sequence sets the pitch of two oscillators and their corresponding sub-oscillators. The principal and feature-set of the script is borrowed from a synthesizer of a similar name. Not a 100% clone, but close.***
