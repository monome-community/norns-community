multi-effects processing for live performance

## install

from maiden type
`;install https://github.com/carltesta/manifold` then `;restart;`

Delay, Pitch-Shifting, Amplitude Modulation, and Audio Freeze available simultaneously for creative audio processing. Request random values to be assigned to the effects within particular ranges to get certain types of sounds. Or, dial in specific values for the effects parameters. Assign parameters to MIDI for more (or less) control in performance. NOTE: Reset audio system after installation because it uses a new SC engine.

## Documentation
plug audio input into channel 1 (L) of norns \
K1 held is alt \
K2 - delay on/off \
K3 - pitchshifter on/off \
E1 - master volume \
E2 - delay time \
E3 - pitch shift rate \
alt + K2 - FREEZE on/off \
alt + K3 - amp mod on/off \
alt + E3 - amp mod frequency \
Assign parameters to a MIDI controller via the parameters menu for greater and more varied control of the values
