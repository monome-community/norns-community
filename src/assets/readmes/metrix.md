# metrix

It's like [intellijel Metropolix](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolix/) for norns. ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è

All functionality and terms are directly adopted from metropolix.
If you're not familiar with it, please have a look at the metropolix manual or do some binge watching on [yt](https://youtu.be/niP5hVB43_8).
And, if you're looking for a nice and powerful eurorack sequencer, consider buying it of course. :)

## Features

- Two independent tracks with 8 stages each
- Control many functions directly via grid (pulse count, gate type, ratchets, probability, pitch, octave, accumulation, slide)
- Set playback direction (forward, reverse, alternate, random) and clock division (1/1 - 1/32) per track
- Loop the whole sequence or choose parts of it
- Quantize to a scale and root note via global params
- Connect to Crow or via MIDI
- Save and load up to 64 presets
- Generate random sequences

## Requirements

- norns (210114)
- grid
- optional: crow
- [molly the poly](https://llllllll.co/t/molly-the-poly/21090)

## Screen

The screen shows a simple representation of the pulse count matrices of the two tracks. 
The selected loop range, as well as the currently playing pulse is being highlighted. 
The dots in the middle show the selected octave ranges.

Beneath every stage you can see a symbol, representing the gate type. 

The bottom row shows the currently played note and octave on the left, the clock 
division in the middle and the playback order on the right. A line beneath the matrix 
indicates the currently selected track and the selected loop range.

In the top right corner, you can see the play state, the top left corner shows the tempo and a little dot to indicate if the sequencer is synced externally.

## Keys and Encoders

- `K2` Play / Pause
- `K3` Reset
- `Enc1` Select Track
- `Enc2` + `Enc3` Select octave ranges

## Grid Layout

The grid layout of **metrix** is strongly influenced by [skylines](https://llllllll.co/t/skylines/38856) and [Kria](https://monome.org/docs/ansible/kria). üôè

### Track Selector

Use the first row to **select** track 1 or 2.

Hold `[shift]` while selecting to **mute/unmute** a track.

### Loopy

Use the second row to set the loop's start and end points:

- Tap and hold the start point and select the end point to set the **looped stages**. This works in any direction.
- Tap on a stage on the currently selected track to select only a **single stage**.
- Hold `[shift]` and tap a single stage to **skip** that stage. One stage must remain active.

### Page Selector

In the bottom left corner, you can choose among the following pages:

1. pulses and gates
2. pitch
3. presets and track settings
4. scales and root note

## Modifier Keys / Shortcuts

In the bottom and top right corner, the `[shift]` and `[mod]` keys are located.
Hold these keys for secondary functions and shortcuts.

Hold the `[shift]` key to switch to the secondary functions of a page.
More on that on the corresponding sections. Also:

| Shortcut                        | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[shift] + [track 1/2]`         | **Mute / unmute** tracks 1 and 2                                                                            |
| `[shift] + [loopy]`             | **Skip** the selected stages. One stage must remain active and cannot be skipped.                           |
| `[mod] + [page 1/2]`            | **Randomize** the basic values related to the selected page                                                 |
| `[mod] + [value]`               | Set **all stages** to the selected value. Use the shift key additionally to access the secondary functions. |
| `[mod] + [loopy]`               | Set loopy's start and stop to **all stages**                                                                |
| `[mod] + [shift] + [track 1/2]` | **Randomize all** possible params. This can lead to unpredictable results.                                  |
| `[mod] + [shift] + [loopy]`     | Set loopy's start and stop to **all stages** and activate all of them                                       |
| `[mod] + [shift] + [page 1/2]`  | **Randomize all** possible params related to the selected page                                              |

## Page 1: Pulses and gates

- Use the top matrix to choose the **pulse count** for each stage.
- Use the bottom matrix to choose the **gate type** for each stage.
- Press and hold `[shift]` to access the matrices for **ratchets** (top) and **probability** (bottom).

<img src="docs/page1.gif" alt="Page 1: Pulses and gates" width="512">

## Page 2: Pitch

- Use the top matrix to choose the **pitch** for each stage.
- Use the bottom matrix to choose the **octave** for each stage. Change the accessible octave range in the params.
- Press and hold `[shift]` to access the matrices for **accumulating transposition** (top), **slide** on/off and **transposition direction** up/down/freeze (bottom).

Notes:

- As the currenty used engine supports **slide** only as a global command, it affects both tracks if using the built-in audio.
- **slide** is _not_ available for MIDI, as the standard doesn't support it

## Page 3: Presets and track settings

- **Save** a preset by holding `[shift]` and selecting on of the 64 preset slots on the top.
- **Load** a preset by tapping one of the preset slots.
- **Delete** a preset by holding `[shift]` and `[mod]` and selecting a preset slot.
- Choose the **playback order** and **clock division** for the corresponding track

<img src="docs/page3.gif" alt="Page 3: Presets and track settings" width="512">

## Page 4: Scales and root note

- **Load** a scale or chord shape
- Choose the **root note**
- The name of the selected scale / note is shown on the screen while holding down a button

## Crow / MIDI

### Crow

Connect crow to connect metrix to your eurorack system:

- Input 1 **syncs the clock** to an external signal (see clock params). Using a permanent 24ppqn signal is recommended to avoid sync issues.
- Input 2 starts the sequencer on a **run** signal (high gate).
- Outputs 1 and 3 send **gates, triggers or envelopes** (adjustable in the params) for each pulse.
- Outputs 2 and 4 send **1v/octave** pitch voltage.

### MIDI

Connect your MIDI device using the corresponding param. Track 1 defaults to MIDI-Channel 1, Track 2 defaults to MIDI-Channel 2. The Channels can also be assigned in the params.
