create an interactive drone machine with three different sound worlds

- three samples are provided
- no USB controllers, no audio input, no engines
- map
   - E1 volume
   - E2 brightness
   - E3 density
   - K2 evolve
   - K3 change worlds
- visual: a different representation for each world

build a drone by locating and layering loops from the provided samples. tune playback rates and filters to discover new territory.

parameters are subject to interpretation. "brightness" could mean filter cutoff, but perhaps something else. "density" could mean the balance of volumes of voices, but perhaps something else. "evolve" could mean a subtle change, but perhaps something else.
