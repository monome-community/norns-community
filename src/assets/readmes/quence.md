## grid usage

### track page

## random tips:

There are 5 pages in total, a settings page and 4 track pages.

After launching the script, the track page for Track One will be visible and the sequencer will be paused.

The bottom row is always the toolbar: pause, mutes for tracks 1-4, lock all, clear all, select tracks 1-4, and settings page.

The LED in the bottom right corner toggles between the current track page and the settings page.

The LED in the bottom left corner toggles the sequencer pause.

On the settings page, the eight buttons in rows 5-6, cols 13-16 are currently unassigned.

For now, pressing any of these LEDs will re-sync all sequences.

Hold Key 3 on the Norns to see the midi notes in the sequence for the current track.
