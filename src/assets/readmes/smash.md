# Troubleshooting

## It's too quiet.
Try any of the following.
- Plug something into the inputs
- Increase *resonance*
- Increase *noise* (slowly)
- Increase *leak* (more slowly)
- Increase *gain* (**VERY** slowly)

## Encoder movements aren't being recorded.
Only E2 is recorded. 
E2 is only recorded during the record phase. 
You can change E2's control while recording, but only one control/value is recorded per SMASH.

## It's too noisy.
Decrease *gain*, *leak*, *noise*, and/or *resonance*.

## I have no idea what's going on
See PARAMETERS menu.
