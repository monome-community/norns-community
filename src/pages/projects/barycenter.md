barycenter: fluctuating relationships
v0.2.0 @echophon

ENC 1 - offset horizon

ENC 2 - adjust space

KEY 2 - cycle space focus

ENC 3 - adjust speed

KEY 3 - cycle speed focus

a script for Norns loosely based on the motion of celestial bodies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter 

two bodies rotate around a central point, two rotate around those, & two more rotate around those to create 8 visible bodies. as the visible bodies cross the horizon notes are struck and sound is made.  symmetry is maintained at a horizon of zero, offsetting the horizon allows for asymmetry
