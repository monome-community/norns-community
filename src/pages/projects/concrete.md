# concrète

virtual tape explorations for norns. ***highly*** inspired by morphagene. not a clone. has a ghost.

load or record audio, cut it into splices, explore the sonic variations with four interlinked play heads, re-record, mangle, dream, dismantle. use concrète as a weird multitap delay, a four-voice polyphonic sample player, or even simple audio tool to cut and export audio files.

**requirements:**

* norns

**supports:**

* grid
* midi
* arc
* crow

**documentation:** [concrète user guide](https://github.com/sonocircuit/concrete/blob/main/doc/CONCRÈTE%20USER%20GUIDE%20v1.0.0.pdf)
