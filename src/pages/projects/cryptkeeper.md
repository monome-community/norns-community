Create and edit `crypts` for [arcologies](https://llllllll.co/t/arcologies-share-with-norns-online/35752) by [tyleretters](https://github.com/northern-information) without leaving norns.

## usage

- e1 = select slot
- hold k1 = load sample
- k2 = alt
- k3 = play
- alt + k3 = toggle loop
- e2 = start point (coarse)
- alt + e2 = start point (fine)
- e3 = end point (coarse)
- alt + e3 = end point (fine)

save/load on last tab. save will overwrite if the name matches an existing crypt directory.
