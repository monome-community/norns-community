# hachi

Euclidean drum machine emulating the TR-808 sound.  
Iâ€™ve written this script to learn Lua, SuperCollider and the norns environment.  
The sound engine is based on the SC808 by [Yoshinosuke Horiuchi](https://www.patreon.com/4H).  
I have implemented only my favorite sounds, to keep the GUI in a single norns page.
The sequencer borrows some techniques from *playfair* euclidean drummer written by [@tehn](https://github.com/tehn) with new features (randomizer, real time recording).
