16 Second looper for Norns

Quick and fun to use, the loop is limited to 16 seconds at regular playback speed, loosly inspired by old loopers like the EHX 16 sec delay.

Playing with speed and slew while recording gives some nice zippy results. The playhead goes a bit wonky after serious tweakage, but maybe that's part of the charm, remember to record your jams to tape ;)

Buttons:

-- K2      : Record // Loop

-- K3      : Play // Stop

-- K1 + K3 : Delete

Knobs:

-- E1      : Slew

-- E2      : Speed

-- E3      : Dub Level
