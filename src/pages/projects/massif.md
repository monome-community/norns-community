# massif
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmat/massif/HEAD/assets/m.png)

a resonator with 8 peaks

## controls
* key 1 = alt

### play

* key 2 = tunes all peaks to random notes of your selected scale, based on the pitch at the left input

*nb: set your scale selection in the parameters menu*

----------

hold alt and press key 3 to enter **edit** mode. 

### edit

* key 2 = tune current peak to the pitch at the left input
* key 3 = hold and play a midi note to tune current peak to the midi note

* alt + encoder 1 = peak select 1 - 8
* encoder 1 = frequency
* encoder 2 = amplitude (be careful with this one, it can get loud)
* encoder 3 = ring time/decay time
