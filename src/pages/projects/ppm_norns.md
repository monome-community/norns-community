# ppm_norns

A single sine tone that reflects the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

When the tone reaches C4, we will have likely reached 1.5c of warming, the threshold for severe climate impacts on people, wildlife and ecosystems.

Suggestions:

- tune your oscillators to the health of the planet
- plug in crow to get a cv output in the 0-10v range on all four channels
- use it as a way to start conversations about climate with music friends

## Requirements

norns, crow (optional)

## Documentation

there are no controls. to change the output, change your habits and elect politicians who support strong and immediate climate action.

## Download

v1.0.0 - Install through Maiden project manager

## Thanks

To @jaseknighter for testing and excellent suggestions, and to @eigen and @infinitedigits for scripting help. To [global-warming.org](http://global-warming.org/) for the co2 API.
