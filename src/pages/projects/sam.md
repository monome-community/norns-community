# sam v1.2

record a sound, adjust the start and end points, save selection to tape.

* key1 = alt
* key2 = start/stop record (starting a new recording clears the buffer)
* key3 = start/stop playback
* enc2 = adjust start point
* enc3 = adjust end point
---
* alt + key3 = save selection to ``/home/we/dust/audio/tape``
* alt + enc2/3 = coarse adjust start/end points
