# SMASH

## Sequencer for apes 🍌

![SMASH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanlaws/SMASH/HEAD/smash.gif)

Two-button stereo LPG / sequencer with extras

# 🙉🙉🙉WARNING!🙉🙉🙉

Can get **VERY LOUD!!!** Protect your ears, ape!

# Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **K2** | 💥**SMASH**💥|
| **K3** | Arm / Play |
| **K1** + **E2** | Select **E2** action |
| **K1** + **E3** | Select **E3** action |
| **E2** | Control something (default *sharpness*) |
| **E3** | Control something else (default *sequencer speed*) |

# Troubleshooting

## It's too quiet.
Try any of the following.
- Plug something into the inputs
- Increase *resonance*
- Increase *noise* (slowly)
- Increase *leak* (more slowly)
- Increase *gain* (**VERY** slowly)

## Encoder movements aren't being recorded.
Only E2 is recorded. 
E2 is only recorded during the record phase. 
You can change E2's control while recording, but only one control/value is recorded per SMASH.

## It's too noisy.
Decrease *gain*, *leak*, *noise*, and/or *resonance*.

## I have no idea what's going on
See PARAMETERS menu.
