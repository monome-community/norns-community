# støy

![støy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imminentgloom/st-y/HEAD/screenshot.png)

(/stœj/) is noise

skittering, scratching, sputtering sounds from a trio of oscillators that respectively feed, fm and am a filter, there is feedback and a delay if you want. a button makes it all (except the delay) stop.

i made this to see if i could play the same kind of music on norns as i have done for years on my modular, they both feel similar, familiar, but also different.

if you want you can play too  

```
v3.0 - smoother param-changes, better grid interaction  
v2.0 - drops state-saving, adds resonant equalizer
```

requires norns, grid recomended

```
K1: shift  
K2: delay send  
K2 + shift: latch delay send  
K3: mute (before eq/del)  
 
E1: hz  
E2: choose (also grid y)  
E3: affect (also grid x)  
  
E1 + shift: EQ dry/wet  
E2 + shift: delay rate  
E3 + shift: feedback  
  
grid + shift: EQ band decay  
```
  
install from maiden or download to ‘dust/code’, then restart norns
