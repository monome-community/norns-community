# Tviburar

*A dual lane four step polyrythmic sequencer where each step contains a free running LFO that will generate notes. The LFO modes are, square, random, ramp up, ramp down and sine. Each step can also be muted. The two sequencers can influence each others LFO values creating a complex environment where the rate of repetition is stretched out over a long, near infinite, timespace.*

The script is based on an original concept built by Filip for the Nord Modular G2.
